Testing out .gitignore :)

This is the DOC I'm currently looking at to help!
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

As I tested out how .gitignore works I figured it out!
If I add the file to .gitignore and push both of them, I then try to "git rm --cache <file>" 
But atlast I figured out that does not work! I have to remove the file from .gitignore and then remove it from cashe!
